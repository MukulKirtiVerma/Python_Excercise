#'expovariate',- expovariate gives you random floating point numbers, exponentially distributed. In a Poisson process the size of the interval between consecutive events is exponential.
x=random.expovariate(15)


#gauss - Gaussian distribution. mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation. This is slightly faster than the normalvariate()
x=random.gauss(1,15)

#getstate -  Return an object capturing the current internal state of the generator. This object can be passed to setstate() to restore the state.
x=random.getstate()

# 'setstate',
#setstate()=Python Random setstate() Method in python is used to restore the state to the specified state of the random number generator.

#normalvariate- normalvariate(mu, sigma) Normal distribution. mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
x=random.normalvariate(1,5)

#seed  - A random seed specifies the start point when a computer generates a random number sequence. This can be any number, but it usually comes from seconds on a computer systemâ€™s clock 
x=random.seed(2)

#Shuffle - Shuffle a list (reorganize the order of the list items)=======
mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

#triangular(left, mode, right, )===================
#Draw samples from the triangular distribution over the interval 
#[left, right].

#The triangular distribution is a continuous probability 
#distribution with lower limit left, peak at mode,
#and upper limit right. Unlike the other distributions, 
#these parameters directly define the shape of the pdf.
x=random.triangular(2,3,50)
print(x)


#vonmisesvariate(mu, kappa) -mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or equal to zero. If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
x=random.vonmisesvariate(1,5)
print(x)


#random.weibullvariate(alpha , beta) -  where alpha is the scale and beta the shape .
